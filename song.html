                <h3>Clair de Lune (1890)</h3>
                <p>
                    Claude Debussy 
                    <br><br>
                    The Suite bergamasque (French pronunciation: ​[sɥit bɛʁɡamask]) is one of the most famous piano suites by Claude Debussy. It was first composed by Debussy around 1890, at the age of 28, but was significantly revised just before its publication in 1905.
                    The third and most famous movement of Suite bergamasque is "Clair de lune", in D♭ major. Its name comes from Verlaine's poem Clair de lune, "moonlight" in French. It is written in 9/8 meter, marked andante très expressif, and to be played mostly pianissimo.

                <h3>La campanella (1851)</h3>
                <p>
                    Franz Liszt
                    <br><br>
                    "La campanella" ("The little bell" in Italian) is the nickname given to the third of Franz Liszt's six Grandes études de Paganini ("Grand Paganini Études"), S. 141 (1851). It is in the key of G-sharp minor. This piece is a revision of an earlier version from 1838, the Études d'exécution transcendente d'après Paganini, S. 140. Its melody comes from the final movement of Niccolò Paganini's Violin Concerto No. 2 in B minor, where the tune was reinforced metaphorically by a 'little handbell'. This is portrayed by the top note jumps that need to be played within the timeframe of a 16th note.

                <h3>Nocturne op.9 No.2 (1830)</h3>
                <p>
                    Frédéric Chopin
                    <br><br>
                    "Air on the G String" is August Wilhelmj's arrangement of the second movement in Johann Sebastian Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D major, BWV 1068.

                    The arrangement differs from the original in that the part of the first violins is transposed down so that it can be played entirely on a violin's lowest string, i.e., the G string. It is played by a single violin (instead of by the first violins as a group).

                    <h3>Arabesque No.1 (1888)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Claude Debussy
                        <br><br>
                        This arabesque is in the key of E major. The piece begins with parallelism of triads in first inversion, a composition technique very much used by Debussy and other Impressionists which traces back to the tradition of fauxbourdon. It leads into a larger section which begins with a left hand arpeggio in E major and a descending right hand E major pentatonic progression.

                    <h3>Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23 (1831)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Frédéric Chopin
                        <br><br>
                        Made during Chopin's eight-month stay in Vienna. It was completed in 1835 after his move to Paris, where he dedicated it to Baron Nathaniel von Stockhausen, the Hanoverian ambassador to France. In 1836 Robert Schumann commented that, "I received a new Ballade from Chopin. It seems to be a work closest to his genius (although not the most ingenious) and I told him that I like it best of all his compositions. After quite a lengthy silence he replied with emphasis, 'I am happy to hear this since I too like it most and hold it dearest.'"

                    <p>
                        Franz Liszt
                        <br><br>
                        It's the second in a set of 19 Hungarian Rhapsodies by composer Franz Liszt, and is by far the most famous of the set.
                        <br>
                        In both the original piano solo form and in the orchestrated version this composition has enjoyed widespread use in animated cartoons. Its themes have also served as the basis of several popular songs.

                    <h3>Étude Op. 25, No. 11 (1836)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Frédéric Chopin 
                        <br><br>
                        It was first published together with all études of Opus 25 in 1837, in France, Germany, and England. The first French edition indicates a common time time signature, but the manuscript and the first German edition both feature cut time. The first four bars that characterize the melody were added just before publication at the advice of Charles A. Hoffmann, a friend.
